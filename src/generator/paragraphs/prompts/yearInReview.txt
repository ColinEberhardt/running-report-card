Create an interesting and engaging narrative for a runner based on their annual running statistics.

name: Jerry
gender: M
distance: 1,740 miles
distance comparison:  run around the world in 14 years
total runs: 251 
hours run: 261
streak: 11
climb: 9,723 metres
climb comparison: El Capitan four times
classification: extreme runner
narrative: In the last year Jerry has been on an impressive 251 runs, covering a total of 1,740 miles over 261 non-stop hours. His longest running streak is 11 days, that's a lot of consecutive days hitting the road (or trail). If he keeps clocking up this mileage he'll have run round the world in 14 years, we think that's an achievable goal. We'd classify jerry as an extreme runner, clocking up an eye-watering number of miles. During these runs he has climbed 9,723 metres, that's the equivalent of climbing El Capitan four times (but a bit less steep).

name: Julie
gender: F
distance: 180 miles
distance comparison: the length of the UK in 3 years
total runs: 54
hours run: 86
streak: 2
climb: 2,316 metres
climb comparison: Snowdon two times
classification: recreational runner
narrative: In the last year Julie has been on a very respectable 54 runs, covering a total of 180 miles over 86 hours. Her longest running streak is just 2 days, c'mon julie, you don't need those rest days! If she keeps clocking up this mileage she'll have run the length of the UK in three years, that's pretty good going, start booking those B&Bs. We'd classify julie as a dedicated recreational runner, clocking up a decent mileage. During these runs she has climbed 2,316 metres, that's the equivalent of climbing Snowdon two times (but a bit less cold)

name: Ed
gender: M
distance: 434 miles
distance comparison: the width of the USA in 7 years
total runs: 128 runs
hours run: 85
streak: 4 
climb: 3,916 metres

classification: serious runner
narrative: In the last year Ed has been on a very respectable 54 runs, covering a total of 434 miles over 85 hours. His longest running streak is 4 days, run-sleep-eat-repeat! If he keeps clocking up this mileage he'll have run the width of the USA in seven years, sounds like a fun challenge. We'd classify Ed as a serious runner, I bet he keeps a close eye on his achievements. During these runs he has climbed 3,916 metres, that's the equivalent of climbing Snowdon four times (without catching the train).

name: Sara
gender: F
distance: 311 miles
distance comparison: the length of the UK in three years
total runs: 79 runs
hours run: 73
streak: 3 
climb: 3,786 metres
climb comparison: climbing Snowdon three times
classification: recreational runner
narrative: We've looked at the data and can see that Sara has pulled on her trainers 79 times this year, clocking up 73 hours of total running time and covering a distance of 311 miles. If she keeps this up she'll have the length of the UK in three years, that sounds like an achievable goal. Based on our assessment, Sara is a recreational runner, she's not letting it take over her whole life! During these runs she has climbed 3,786 metres, that's the equivalent of climbing Snowdon three times, worth it for the view.

name: Sara
gender: unknown
distance: 211 miles
distance comparison: the length of the UK in five years
total runs: 49 runs
hours run: 43
streak: 1 
climb: 2,786 metres
climb comparison: climbing Snowdon once
classification: recreational runner
narrative: We've looked at the data and can see that Sara has pulled on their trainers 49 times this year, clocking up 43 hours of total running time and covering a distance of 211 miles, that's a fairly modest number of miles. If they keep this up they'll have the length of the UK in five years, that's a big commitment. Sara is a recreational runner, they clearly have other things to do with their time! During these runs they has climbed 2,786 metres, that's the equivalent of climbing Snowdon just once, but once is enough!
